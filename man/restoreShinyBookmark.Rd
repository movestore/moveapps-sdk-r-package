\title{Restore Shiny Bookmark}
\usage{
restoreShinyBookmark(session)
}
\arguments{
\item{session}{A Shiny session object, typically provided by the Shiny server function.}
}
\value{
No return value, called for side effects (session reload and logging).
}
\description{
Automatically restores the latest Shiny bookmark if one exists and hasn't been
loaded yet. This function checks for an existing bookmark and reloads the session
with the appropriate state ID to restore the application state.
}
\details{
The function performs the following checks and operations:
\enumerate{
\item Checks if a bookmark file exists in the "latest" location
\item Verifies that no state ID is currently present in the session URL
\item If both conditions are met, updates the query string to load the "latest" bookmark
\item Reloads the session to apply the bookmarked state
\item Logs the operation for debugging purposes
}

This function should typically be called during Shiny application initialization
to automatically restore the user's last saved state.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# In a Shiny server function

  # Restore bookmark on app start
  restoreShinyBookmark(session)

  # ... rest of server logic
}
